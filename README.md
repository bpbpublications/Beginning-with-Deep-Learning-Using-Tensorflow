# Beginning with Deep Learning Using TensorFlow

A Practicing Guide to TensorFlow and Deep Learning

This is the repository for [Beginning with Deep Learning Using TensorFlow](https://bpbonline.com/products/beginning-with-deep-learning-using-tensorflow?_pos=1&_sid=1976b737f&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications
## About the Book
This book begins with the configuration of an Anaconda development environment, essential for practicing the deep learning process. The basics of machine learning, which are needed for Deep Learning, are explained in this book.
TensorFlow is the industry-standard library for Deep Learning, and thereby, it is covered extensively with both versions, 1.x and 2.x. As neural networks are the heart of Deep Learning, the book explains them in great detail and systematic fashion, beginning with a single neuron and progressing through deep multilayer neural networks. The emphasis of this book is on the practical application of key concepts rather than going in-depth with them.
After establishing a firm basis in TensorFlow and Neural Networks, the book explains the concepts of image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), followed by speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, this book discusses Transformers, the most recent advancement in NLP.
